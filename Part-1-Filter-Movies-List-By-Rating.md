# Part 1 - Filter The Movies List By Rating

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read this whole page before starting to code!  There are hints and an overview of the big picture here!

Enhance the RottenPotatoes application as follows: At the top of the All Movies listing (`/movies`), add some
checkboxes that allow the user to filter the list to show only movies with certain MPAA ratings:

![Screenshot. The filter should be included somewhere below the page heading. It should have a checkbox for each 
rating, followed by a "Refresh" button.](lib/assets/filter-screenshot.png)

When the Refresh button is pressed, the list of movies is redisplayed showing only those movies whose ratings were 
checked. If _no_ boxes are checked, after a user hits the Refresh button, all movies should be listed, and all 
checkboxes should be checked. It also applies to the first time when the user visits the page (i.e. when the user 
visits the page, all checkboxes should be checked).

This will require a couple of pieces of code. We have provided the code that generates the checkboxes form, which you 
can include in the `index.html.erb` template.  (The `id` attributes on some of the elements are required for the 
autograder to work, so don't change/delete them.)

```erb
<%= form_tag movies_path, method: :get, id: 'ratings_form', local: true do %>
  Include:
  <% @all_ratings.each do |rating| %>
    <div class="form-check  form-check-inline">
      <%= check_box_tag "ratings[#{rating}]", "1", @ratings_to_show.include?(rating), class: 'form-check-input' %>
      <%= label_tag "ratings[#{rating}]", rating, class: 'form-check-label' %>
    </div>
  <% end %>
  <%= submit_tag 'Refresh', id: 'ratings_submit', class: 'btn btn-primary' %>
  
<% end %>
```

BUT, you have to do a bit of work to use the above code:

1. As you can see, it expects the variable `@all_ratings` to be an enumerable collection of all possible values of a 
movie rating, such as `['G','PG','PG-13','R']`. The controller action needs to set up this variable. And since the
possible values of movie ratings are really the responsibility of the `Movie` model, it's best if the controller sets 
this variable by consulting the `Model`. Hence, good form would be to create a class method of `Movie` that returns an 
appropriate value for this collection, say `Movie.all_ratings`, and have the controller assign that to the appropriate 
instance variable for the view to pick up.

2. The [Rails documentation](https://api.rubyonrails.org/) for `check_box_tag` says that the third value, evaluated as
a Boolean, tells whether the checkbox should be displayed as checked or not. In the code above, `@ratings_to_show` is
assumed to be a collection of which ratings should be checked.  So `@ratings_to_show.include?('G')` would be true if 
`'G'` was a member of the collection. The controller action must also set up this array, _even if no check boxes are
checked._

<details>
<summary>
Why must the controller set up a default value for <code>@ratings_to_show</code> even if nothing is checked?
</summary>
<blockquote>
If it doesn't, then <code>@ratings_to_show</code> will have a <code>nil</code> value in the view, and trying to call
<code>nil.include?</code> will cause an exception.
</blockquote>
</details>

You will also need code in the controller that knows (i) how to figure out which boxes the user checked and (ii) how
to restrict the database query based on that result.

Regarding (i), try viewing the source (right click and click View Page Source) of the movie listings with the checkbox
form, and you'll see that the checkboxes have field names like `ratings[G]`, `ratings[PG]`, etc. This trick will cause
Rails to aggregate the values into a single hash called `ratings`, whose keys will be the names of the checked boxes
only, and whose values will be the value attribute of the checkbox (which is "1" by default, since we didn't specify
another value when calling the `check_box_tag` helper). That is, if the user checks the **G** and **R** boxes, `params`
will include as one of its values `:ratings=>{"G"=>"1", "R"=>"1"}`. Check out the `Hash` documentation for an easy way
to grab just the keys of a hash, since we don't care about the values in this case (checkboxes that weren't checked
don't appear in the `params` hash at all).

Regarding (ii), you'll probably end up replacing `Movie.all` in the controller method. Since most interesting code
should go in the model rather than exposing details of the schema to the controller, consider defining a class-level
method in the model such as `Movie.with_ratings(ratings)` that takes an array of ratings (e.g. `["r", "pg-13"]`) and
returns an `ActiveRecord` relation of movies whose rating matches (case-insensitively) anything in that array. To do 
its job, this method can make use of `Movie.where`, which has various options to help you restrict the database query.

> (on the docs page, click the flippy triangle next to the class name `ActiveRecord` and find the interior class 
> `Base`) for examples of how to use `where` to do queries like this. The

## IMPORTANT for grading purposes

* As in the code above, your `form` tag should have the `id` `ratings_form` and the form `submit` button for filtering 
by ratings should have the `id` `ratings_submit`.
* Each checkbox should have an HTML element `id` of `ratings_#{rating}`, where the interpolated rating should be the 
rating itself, such as `ratings_PG-13`, `ratings_G`, and so on.

## More Hints

_We suggest_ adding a class method in `Movie` as follows:

```ruby
class Movie < ApplicationRecord
  def self.with_ratings(ratings_list)
  # if ratings_list is an array such as ['G', 'PG', 'R'], retrieve all
  #  movies with those ratings
  # if ratings_list is nil, retrieve ALL movies
  end
end
```

Using the debugger, take a look at what is in `params[]` when the form is submitted with various checkboxes checked, 
and particularly, what is in `params[:ratings]` (or `params['ratings']` -- special hashes in Rails such as `params` 
and `session` can be accessed by either strings or symbols, even though hashes in Ruby do not generally behave this 
way).

Notice that you will need to use the `params[:ratings]` values in two ways in the controller: to determine what values
to pass to `Movie.with_ratings`, and to set a variable that can be used by the view so that the appropriate checkboxes 
show up as checked when the filtered view is loaded.

## Pay attention to...

**Labels** You may notice that we have included a HTML `label` alongside the checkbox. These labels are critical for a 
properly functioning form! Primarily, they tell users what checkbox they are about to select. However, labels also 
provide built-in accessibility features (such as for blind users, so they too know what each checkbox does) or handy 
shortcuts like clicking "G" to apply the "G" checkbox. (On a phone, for example, this means users are less likely to 
tap on the wrong action.)

**Reminder** Don't put logic in your views! If you find yourself doing computation in your views, set up an instance 
variable in the controller and do the computation there instead. And if the computation is anything more than trivial, 
it probably belongs in a model, not in the controller.

## Deploying this feature

Once you've verified that your code works (by running the Rails server locally and trying it), we'll try deploying what 
we've made so far to Heroku. Use the `main` branch of your repository. That means we'll have to merge our current branch
into `main`, which is most easily accomplished with a pull request on GitHub.

First, **make a commit** to your feature branch with all of your changes, then push the branch's updates to GitHub. 
Use the same technique as in previous CHIPS to create a pull request, then merge that pull request into your 
repository's `main` branch.

Once you've done this, your GitHub repository's `main` branch will be up to date with your latest changes. Return to
a shell on your local machine and check out the `main` branch on your local repository:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Then, you can pull the new, updated version of `main` from the `origin` remote (your GitHub repository) into your 
local repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

And, since you won't need the feature branch anymore, you can clean up by deleting the local branch:

```bash
git branch -d <OLD_BRANCH_NAME>
```

There's also a button on GitHub that will do this for you for the copy of the branch that existed on the remote.

Now, we can deploy the updated `main` branch to Heroku. In professional settings, different teams will have different 
approaches, but it's common to deploy to the production web server only from the `main` branch, rather than making 
deploys from potentially out-of-date feature branches.

```bash
git push heroku main
```

Use a browser to ensure that the application is running on Heroku, and have a peek at the new changes to make sure 
they're working properly before moving onto the next section.
